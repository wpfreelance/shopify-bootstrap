{% comment note:
  The base markup for our different collection templates is actually all the same
  The difference in templates is achieved by the styles
  We differentiate between each template by the template class on the body tag
  
  We can set different details to be displayed inside each thumb by setting global vars
  e.g. display product description, etc.
